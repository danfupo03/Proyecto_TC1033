# Registration of populations and species in a reserve

## Context

There are many reserves around the world and many times scientists require a way in which they can record species and their populations. An example of this type of reserve is the El Cimatario National Park, which is located in the state of Quer√©taro. Many species live here and it can be difficult to keep track of all of them.

## Functionality

This code makes it possible to keep a record of all the species that inhabit the reserve as well as their populations, and if it is later discovered that a new species has migrated to that reserve, it can be added directly to the code with one of the options. In addition, the registry is divided into mammals, reptiles and amphibians so that the count can be carried out in a more orderly manner.

## Considerations

- When introducing a new species, do not write a space, everything must be together.
- If you write a different number to the menu options the code will close automatically.
